## Election_Audit Summary
As you can see, this is a very handy script for displaying voter turnout data. To take it a step further, one might base who they voted for due to their occupation. We could collect the occupations and display data based on what occupation primarily voted for each candidate. You could also display the runner-up by displaying the second place votes.
